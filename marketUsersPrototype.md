# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored* 

1. https://www.airbnb.com/
2. https://www.booking.com/
3. https://www.vrbo.com/

*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 

These websites are relevant comparisons because they are all hospitalty websites that help the user find whole-home rentals.

*List at least 10 product features*
 1.  Users can choose what type of house or residence they want in the navbar (castle, mansion, cabin, etc)
 2.  Users can bundle flight and rental
 3.  Users can save trips in a seperate "my trips" tab
 4.  Users can choose how many guests from the front page as well as pets
 5.  Users can filter by the amount of rooms in the property
 6.  Users can see popular destinations on the main page
 7.  Users can select the currency they want to see on the page
 8.  Users can search areas by attractions
 9.  Users can search for homes in specific locations
 10. Users can share individual listings on multiple platforms



## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that most users are looking for a certain type of vacation, but are not sure where exactly to go. This is made evident through the quantitative user research as well as the qualitative user research which showed that some users had difficulty finding a vacation home with just the type of vacation they want and not the location. I think the users want a streamlined experience that allows them to find a vacation home with the criteria they want and then they can pick the location.



## Define and Prototype
*Paste a link to your prototype here* 
> **üóíÔ∏è NOTE:** Make sure you share your prototype file so that "anyone with the link" can view it. If we're unable to access your file, we'll be unable to give you credit. 

*Don't forget to include a comment if you attempted any of the LevelUps, so that your grader knows to review your work and award the extra credit!*
